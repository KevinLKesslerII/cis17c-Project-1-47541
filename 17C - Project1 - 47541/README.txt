Welcome to the Pokemon TCG Pocket Simulator!

Note: This is still a WiP and may not run properly

RULES:
Each player plays available Pokemon from their hand to their Bench and Active Zone
Pokemon battle until someone loses a Pokemon.
Normal Pokemon are worth 1 point
Pokemon with "ex" in their name are worth 2.
First player to earn 3 points wins

GAMEPLAY:
Choose a deck to use from the 3 available
Coin Toss decides who goes first (Heads goes first)
Players start with 5 cards in hand adn draw 1 card at the beginning of their turn
You must play a Basic Pokemon in the active zone to start and you can optionally place 3 pokemon in your bench
1 energy corresponding to your deck will be generated each turn and this energy can be place on any of your available Pokemon
Energy is used for attacks and retreating (swapping your active Pokemon with one on your bench)
Pokemon can be evolved to the next stage after being on the field for at least 1 turn.
Item cards can be played on your turn as long as you have them
Supporter Cards can only be played once per turn
Once a player attacks with their active Pokemon, their turn ends and the next player's turn begins
This loop continues until a player earns 3 points from KO'ing their opponents Pokemon

Have fun!!
